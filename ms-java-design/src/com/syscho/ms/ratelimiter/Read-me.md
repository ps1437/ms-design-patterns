# Rate Limiter Implementation  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Rate Limiter** using two different algorithms:  

1. **Fixed Window Rate Limiter** â€“ Limits the number of requests per second using a fixed time window.  
2. **Token Bucket Rate Limiter** â€“ Controls request flow by refilling tokens at a fixed rate.  

Both limiters are integrated into a **Payment Service**, which enforces rate limits before processing payments.  

## Components  

### 1. Fixed Window Rate Limiter (`FixedWindowRateLimiter.java`)  
- Allows a fixed number of requests per second.  
- Resets the request count every second.  
- If the request count exceeds the limit, further requests are denied.  

### 2. Token Bucket Rate Limiter (`RateLimiterTokenBased.java`)  
- Uses tokens to regulate request flow.  
- Tokens are replenished at a fixed rate.  
- A request is allowed only if a token is available.  

### 3. Payment Service (`PaymentService.java`)  
- Uses both rate limiting strategies to control payment requests.  
- If rate limits are exceeded, the request is blocked.  

### 4. Main Class (`RateLimiterMain.java`)  
- Simulates multiple concurrent requests to test the rate limiting behavior.  
- Uses a thread pool to generate requests.  

## How It Works  
- The `RateLimiterMain` class creates multiple requests in parallel.  
- Requests go through the `PaymentService`, which applies rate limiting.  
- If allowed, the payment is processed; otherwise, it's rejected.  

## Running the Project  
1. Compile the Java files.  
2. Run `RateLimiterMain.java`.  
3. Observe the request behavior in the console output.  

## Use Cases  
- Prevent **API abuse** by limiting excessive requests.  
- Control **service load** to avoid server overload.  
- Implement **fair usage policies** in applications.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Support **configurable time windows**.  
- Add **distributed rate limiting** using Redis.  
- Improve **logging and monitoring** for better insights.
